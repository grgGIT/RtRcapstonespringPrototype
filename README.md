# ðŸš• Race to Riches

## Concept

**Race to Riches** is a trivia-based game inspired by the TV show *Cash Cab*. Youâ€™ll meet **Zilby**, an intergalactic taxi driver from the planet **Glimmeron**, who accidentally crashes on Earth.  

To help Zilby return home, youâ€™ll need to earn **Cosmic Coins** by answering questions and completing challenges. The faster you earn, the sooner Zilby gets home. Think you can fund his journey?
